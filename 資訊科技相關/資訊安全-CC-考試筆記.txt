ISC2 Code of Ethics(道德宣言)
  All information security professionals who are certified by ISC2 recognize that such certification is a privilege that must be both earned and maintained. In support of this principle, all ISC2 members are required to commit to fully support this Code of Ethics (the "Code"). ISC2 members who intentionally or knowingly violate any provision of the Code will be subject to action by a peer review panel, which may result in the revocation of certification. ISC2 members are obligated to follow the ethics complaint procedure upon observing any action by an ISC2 member that breach the Code. Failure to do so may be considered a breach of the Code pursuant to Canon IV. 
  所有獲得 ISC2 認證的資訊安全專業人員都認識到，此類認證是一種必須獲得和維持的特權。為了支持這項原則，所有 ISC2 成員都必須承諾全力支持本道德準則（「準則」）。故意或故意違反本準則任何規定的 ISC2 成員將受到同儕審查小組的處罰，這可能會導致認證被撤銷。 ISC2 成員在發現 ISC2 成員違反本準則的任何行為後，有義務遵守道德申訴程序。根據 Canon IV 的規定，如果不這樣做，可能會被視為違反本準則。

  There are only four mandatory canons in the Code. By necessity, such high-level guidance is not intended to be a substitute for the ethical judgment of the professional.
